# House-Price-Prediction

After downloading the data, Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the data, which included the following:
  * Data Cleaning
  * Data Visualisation
  * Outlier Detection and Removal
  * Data Standardisation

<br> 
Three different types of approaches were taken to predict the House price:
  * Classification models(Naive Bayes and SVM) - The house prices were categorised by labelling them according to the intervals they fell into. 
    The models were trained and used to fit the data, but the accuracy was very less(around 25%).
 
  * Artificial Neural Network- A Sequential model was built and trained for 100 epochs. The loss was substantially less.
 
  * Linear Regression- A simple Linear Regression model was built to fit the data, and the model gave a great score of 0.97.
 
 <br>
 Based on the results of the three approaches, the <b>Linear Regression</b> model should be used to predict the House prices.
